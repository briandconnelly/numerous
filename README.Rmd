[![Project Status: Abandoned - Initial development has started, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release; the project has been abandoned and the author(s) do not intend on continuing development.](http://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/abandoned.svg)](http://www.repostatus.org/#abandoned)
[![CRAN_Status_Badge](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/numerous)](http://cran.r-project.org/package=numerous)

**Note: Numerous is [shutting down](http://blog.numerousapp.com/2016/02/02/numerous-shutting-down-on-may-1.html), so this package is no longer being developed.**

[Numerous](http://numerousapp.com) is a service for sharing and following numbers such as stock prices, temperatures, the number of processes running on a server, or the number of times you've visited the gym this week.
This package allows you to create, modify, and interact with data on numerous quickly and easily from within R through the [Numerous API](https://developer.numerousapp.com).


## Installation

This package is not quite ready to be available on [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org), but you can use [devtools](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/index.html) to install the current development version:

```{r Installing with devtools, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("briandconnelly/numerous")
```


## First: Getting Your API key

Before you can interact with Numerous, you'll need to get your key.
Launch the mobile application ([iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/numerous-lifes-most-important/id797642904?mt=8), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.numerousapp)), and go to *Settings* and *Developer Info*.

![Finding your API key](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/briandconnelly/numerous/master/figures/screenshot_apikey.png)

In this screenshot, we see that our API key is **nmrs_S7ZEna7Pmjg7**.
Keep this number handy, as you'll need it right away.
Optionally, you can save the key in your environment as `NUMEROUS_API_KEY` (or whatever else you'd like).


## Getting Started

Now that you've installed the numerous package, installed the mobile app, and found your API key, it's time to get started.

Start up R and load the package:

```{r Loading the package, eval=FALSE}
library(numerous)
```

Now, we're going to set the API key using the `set_numerous_key` function.
This must be done before interacting with Numerous.


### The Manual Option

The most straightforward way to set your key is to provide it as the `key` argument to `set_numerous_key`:

```{r Setting your API key v1, eval=FALSE}
set_numerous_key(key = "nmrs_S7ZEna7Pmjg7")
```

Of course, you'll want to replace **nmrs_S7ZEna7Pmjg7** with your own key.


### Setting the Key from Your Environment

You can also use the value of an environment variable to set the key.
This is especially useful if you use Numerous in multiple ways (e.g., Python scripts, shell scripts, etc.).
To specify where to find your key, use the `env` argument.
For example, if you stored your key in the variable `MY_NUMEROUS_KEY`:

```{r Setting your API key v2, eval=FALSE}
set_numerous_key(env = "MY_NUMEROUS_KEY")
```

By default, this package uses `NUMEROUS_API_KEY`, so if you've saved your key there, you can just run:

```{r Setting your API key v3, eval=FALSE}
set_numerous_key()
```

Now that your key is set, it's time to start working with Numerous.


## Viewing a Metric

We can get information about a metric using the `get_metric` function and specifying that
metric's ID. If you don't know any metrics, we can get a list of the most popular ones
using `get_popular_metrics`. Here, we'll use the `count` argument to get the most popular metric:

```{r Getting the Most Popular Metric}
pop_metric <- get_popular_metrics(count = 1)
```

We can now get some information about this metric by looking at its values. For example,
we can get the metric's *label* and its current *value*:

```{r Metric 2roperties 1}
pop_metric[[1]]$label
pop_metric[[1]]$value
```

So this metric is called *Phase of the Moon*, and its current value is 0.36.

If you'd like to see the current phase of the moon any time you want on your mobile device, you can subscribe to it:

```{r Subscribing}
subinfo <- subscribe(metric_id = pop_metric[[1]]$id)
```

`subinfo` now stores information about your subscription.


## Creating a Metric

We're really here to interact with our own metrics. Let's create a new one
called "Fun-O-Meter" that stores a value as a percent. Since we're just getting
started, we'll set the initial value to 0.33.

```{r Creating a metric}
funometer <- create_metric(label = "Fun-O-Meter", kind = "percent", value = 0.33)
```

Our new Fun-O-Meter metric is now ready to go. If you take a look at `funometer`,
you'll see it contains all the basic information.

```{r Looking at our new metric}
funometer
```


## Updating a Metric's Value

In Numerous speak, an *event* updates the value of a metric. Let's first set the
value of our Fun-O-Meter to a "meh" 0.5:

```{r Updating a metric Part 1, eval = FALSE}
create_event(metric_id = funometer$id, value = 0.5)
```

Events can also increment a value by a given amount. Because we're so excited about
this, we're going to update the Fun-O-Meter to the "not bad" territory by adding
0.1:

```{r Updating a metric Part 2, eval = FALSE}
create_event(metric_id = funometer$id, value = 0.1, add=TRUE)
```


## Setting Notifications

TODO - use update_subscription() to get notifications whenever fun-o-meter goes above 90%


## Plotting a Metric's Values

We can easily plot a metric's value over time using R's base graphics. Here,
we'll get the "[Phase of the Moon](http://n.numerousapp.com/m/174g84eoxlja8)" metric and plot its values.

```{r Basic plot}
moonphase <- get_metric(metric_id = "5676005772602922464")
plot(moonphase)
```

Different labels and other properties can be specified using the
standard graphical parameters. Here, we'll change the labels and plot lines 
instead of points:

```{r Plot with updated labels}
plot(moonphase, type = "l", xlab = "Month", ylab = "Value")
```


### Plotting with ggplot

Creating plots with [ggplot2](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html) is also
easy. We'll first get a data frame containing a metric's values by using the `df`
option to `get_events` and then create a plot using that data frame.

```{r Plotting with ggplot}
library(ggplot2)
library(scales)

moon_events <- get_events(metric_id = moonphase$id, df = TRUE)
ggplot(data = moon_events, aes(x=updated, y=value)) +
    geom_line() +
    scale_x_datetime(breaks = date_breaks("1 month"),
                     minor_breaks = date_breaks("1 week")) +
    labs(title=moonphase$label)
```
